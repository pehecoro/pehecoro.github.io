Day 93 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I continued the Breakout game tutorial. It is simply amazing how it's possible to abstract several processes that I did before manually and get to the point where I am. Danger of me getting too excited and leaving for a specific game right after the end of this project.   
Today I created the levels (also a random level generator with some criteria), the player with the basic movements and all of them rendered successfully \o/   
Thanks to [learnopengl.com][learnopengl]
