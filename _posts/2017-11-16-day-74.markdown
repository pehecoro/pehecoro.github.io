Day 74 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw the last videos of the course. Too bad, but I will look for other courses from the same author! I finished with the topics of Regular expressions and Regular Expressions iterators. And despite knowing the regular expressions, the author exemplified with very interesting situations and even downloaded a webpage to manipulate it (through the class we created) and collect certain information with the regular expression. As always, it was possible to follow up and make my own variations.

_Have a great day =)_
