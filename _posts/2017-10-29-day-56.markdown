Day 56 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I saw and practiced some more pluralsight videos. Topics covered were Compile Time Assertions, Unicode Literals, Raw Literals, and User Defined Literals. All topics were cool, but I liked User Defined Literals more, because I could have more control of the literals in a very exotic way, at least for me.

_Have a great day =)_
