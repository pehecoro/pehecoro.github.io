Day 38 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I learned more "about OpenGL". This time I saw how to render objects from exported models of 3D modeling tools. As each tool can export in its own way, the tutorial proposes the use of Assimp, a model loading library. With Assimp I will only worry about how it structures the received data, so I started to make a class to receive these values, which before I put them manually, and draw them.

_Have a great day =)_
