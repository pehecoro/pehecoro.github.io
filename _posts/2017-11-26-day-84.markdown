Day 84 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I continued to progress at FreeCodeCamp. So, Although I've already seen some subjects covered, I believe that I'm solidifying my knowledge of CSS and HTML. After, I proceeded with the course of Beautiful C++. This time about Sorting, a topic I had already seen superficially and which I now see in more detail.

_Have a great day =)_
