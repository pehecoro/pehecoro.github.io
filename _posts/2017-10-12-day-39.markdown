Day 39 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I finished reading the Model section and I was able to load my first model in openGL !!! It was very nice to see the model in my program! However, I still have some doubts at some points in the process, so I'll still read more about it and continue to implement the lamps in the scenario with my new model.

_Have a great day =)_
