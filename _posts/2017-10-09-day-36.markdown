Day 36 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I read a little more of Scott Meyers' book and I continued the OpenGL tutorial on Light Casters. It is very interesting to replicate the various effects of our reality, and replicating the Flashlight that I had to try for GLSL was even cooler. I realized that it was not exactly what I had done in GLSL, as expected, but I think the idea was similar.

_Have a great day =)_
