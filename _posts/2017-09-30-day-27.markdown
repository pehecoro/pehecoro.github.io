Day 27 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I continued to see some Pluralsight videos and I was able to practice them by creating some simple examples. I saw about In-class initializers, inheriting, delegating constructors, default and deleted methods, override and final keywords. Some things I had seen, but anyway, as always, I changed a few uses to clarify my understanding.

_Have a great day =)_
