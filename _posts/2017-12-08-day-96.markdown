Day 96 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I read the topic of Anti Aliasing. As the next part of the Breakout tutorial requires knowledge about Anti Aliasing, I studied a little about and implemented MSAA, a very easy to implement Anti Aliasing technique in OpenGL.   
Here's an example in my project:

{% endraw %}

_Have a great day =)_
