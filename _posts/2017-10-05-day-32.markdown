Day 32 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I tried to follow just one line for my simple project of manipulating files. It has its parts close to the C, but I try to bring the learning about C++ to the maximum. Either way, it's fun to manipulate some things at a "low level". As it can still change the whole structure, I leave it to a next moment to post the code

_Have a great day =)_
