Day 82 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I did a series of Free Code Camp exercises on HTML and CSS. I found it very cool how they structured the practice to the concept. After, I started Kate Gregory's Beautiful C++ course. As I had already seen a course of it, I wasn't surprised by the continuity of the great course quality. This time it's mainly about the use of the C++ Standard Library (known as STL), a simply amazing 'feature set' that is sometimes not used for lack of knowledge. I also took advantage of it to practice some design patterns.

_Have a great day =)_
