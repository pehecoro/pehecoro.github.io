Hello my friend,

Today I'll begin my #100DaysOfCode. Taking advantage of this, I created this blog to talk more about what I am doing and anything else that I do.


> # I have to:
> 1. Code at least an hour every day.
> 2. Tweet my progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag


If you want to know more about the #100DaysOfCode, checkout the [100DaysOfCode Challenge][code-challenge]

Now my main purpose is to learn the C++ programming language. To do that I intend to follow the book

###### _Beginning C++ Through Game Programming by Michael Dawson_  
![Beginning C++ Through Game Programming 4th edition]({{site.url}}/images/cppBook.jpeg)  

Since I was already reading the book then I'll continue from Chapter 3.

__Meet me on the battlefield__
