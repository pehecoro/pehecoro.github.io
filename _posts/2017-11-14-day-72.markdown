Day 72 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw more about Associative Containers. This time on Map, Multimap and Unordered_Map. They all have their advantages and disadvantages, obviously like everything in life, I believe. Either way, it was quite interesting to implement them and vary their uses to understand well. I want to continue to manipulate a bit more and relate them seeing the implementation of the containers through Visual Studio =).

_Have a great day =)_
