Day 99 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today, using the small audio track offered by [learnopengl.com][learnopengl], I put the sounds to make the game even cooler. As suggested by the author, I used the IRRKLANG library. It's a fairly simple library to use, but it has some limitations in licensing.   

_Have a great day =)_
