Day 48 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw two more items from Scott Meyers' book. As always, these are things I did not think much about but that make a difference, however, I have not yet had the opportunity to see this in practice. These items deal with storing objects created with new in smart pointers in self-contained sentences and make the interfaces easy to use correctly and difficult to use incorrectly.

_Have a great day =)_
