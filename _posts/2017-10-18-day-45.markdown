Day 45 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I've seen items about having the assignment operators return a reference to _*this_, treating the auto-assignments in _operator=_ and copying all parts of an object. Since I don't have a specific project to apply these effective practices, I create simple examples that apply them. As always, I update my learning-cpp repository with all examples.

_Have a great day =)_
