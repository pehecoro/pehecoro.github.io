Day 66 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I continued with the C ++ course and started to see about Smart Classes. I am much better suited to this instructor, he always exemplifies and I can follow along with my code without problems. In the course we are using the Windows API which made it even more interesting and exciting. I often remember and learn from the instructor some optimizations that I have followed in some places, which makes it even more enriching. Inside the module I followed the initial construction of the class together with resource management and member functions.

_Have a great day =)_
