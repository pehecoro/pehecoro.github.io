Day 68 of 100

Hello my friend,

I saw a little bit about container, elements (container objects) and swapping. It was interesting to see the cost of the swap by the standard library and implement a proper one for the class, thinking about Argument-dependent lookup. Through ADL, implementing a "proper" function, code optimization became clear. In the example I created, there was no more creation of a temporary variable or Move Assignment or Move Constructor for the swap.

_Have a great day =)_
