Day 26 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I was able to renew my Pluralsight account for 3 months. I was quite happy to be able to continue my studies in Pluralsight. Well, I've repeated the examples, and I've tried to change some things to better understand. Anyway I had to go to other places to have other points of view that made me consolidate the knowledge acquired. I was able to get a better idea about Variadic Template, Template Aliases, Template Arguments and extern Templates.

_Have a great day =)_
