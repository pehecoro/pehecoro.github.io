Day 29 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I continued reading the effective c ++ and saw some more pluralsight videos. This time about an introduction of Move semantics and lvalue / rvalue. I followed the examples presented in Visual Studio and tried to modify them. There was one that shouldn't to compile but compiled

{% highlight cpp%}
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class JetPlane
{
    string _model;
public:
    JetPlane() = default;
    JetPlane(const string& model) : _model(model)
    {}
};

int main() {
    JetPlane& p = JetPlane(); //error: cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type 'JetPlane&' to an rvalue of type 'JetPlane'

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight cpp%}


So when talking to a colleague about the "mystery", I realized it was a "help" from the Visual Studio compiler.  
The same code in the GCC which is the compiler used in the course gives the error during compilation as expected.

_Have a great day =)_
