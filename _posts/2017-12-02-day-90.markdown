Day 90 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I read about Framebuffers. I had read a little while ago but I had gone back to C++, so I read again the beginning and revise some buffers to understand better.   
GLFW already created a default framebuffer and took care of some details for me, but now I am able to create one that is bound to an output color buffer. So with this buffer I can make some nice modifications.   
Based on what I am still learning, I tried to simulate the effect of a toy in WoW that modifies the player's view.   
Before:   
![BeforeFramebuffers]({{"/images/beforeFramebuffers.png" | https://pehecoro.github.io/images/beforeFramebuffers.png}})   
After:   
![AfterFramebuffers]({{"/images/afterFramebuffers.png" | https://pehecoro.github.io/images/afterFramebuffers.png}})   

_Have a great day =)_
