Day 35 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I finished redoing the OpenGL project I was in, causing me a lot of problems, which was great, because I had to remember and search a series of details. Well, after that I continued with OpenGL learning, concluding parts of the tutorial for Directional Light and Point lights.

_Have a great day =)_
