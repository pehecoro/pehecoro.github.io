Day 94 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I developed breakout collisions. Initially, I created, along with the tutorial, the collision between rectangles (assuming the ball would be treated in the collision as a rectangle), which I had already done some time ago by SDL. Although I had no difficulty with this collision, the next one that was suggested gave me a bit of work to understand, it was the most accurate collision between the circle (ball) and the rectangle (brick). After a calm reading I got a better understanding and I also implemented as indicated by the site.

_Have a great day =)_
