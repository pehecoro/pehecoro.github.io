Day 73 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw a presentation on Youtube of Time Travel Debugging (TTD) in CppCon and I took the opportunity to apply it recreating the study of yesterday. It was a way I found of putting together something that I found interesting with a revision of the seen previously. After I continued the course and saw some features of the string, there was functionality that I didn't know and some that I could review.

_Have a great day =)_
