Day 67 of 100

Hello my friend,

I continued building my Smart Class using the Windows API. This time I implemented the copy constructor and move constructor. Then I started mapping a file through my Handle class over the Windows API. The cool thing is that I can still see applications of some things I learned in Effective C++.

_Have a great day =)_
