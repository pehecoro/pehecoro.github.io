Day 30 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw a video of Jason Turner - "Rich Code for Tiny Computers: A Simple Commodore 64 Game in C ++ 17". It was a very interesting video and had its very funny moments like when he added const to the static array and the code generated by the compiler has decreased dramatically. After I started to create a program that makes modifications to files specified by the user, anyway I ended up changing so much the way to do it that I could not finish any part.

_Have a great day =)_
