Day 71 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I read a bit of Effective C++ and continued with C++ course with Associative Containers. I have seen some advantages and the use of the set in spite of having already implemented. Once again, I followed the course practicing and taking advantage to look at some implementations made by MSVC++.

_Have a great day =)_
