Day 31 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I kept reading Scott Meyers' book. It's a great book with great explanations of certain practices that, fortunately, are including parts I've seen in C++. After I did some small programs to test and reinforce my understanding of lvalue and rvalue. And I continue my little project of manipulating files.

_Have a great day =)_
