Day 61 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I've seen more Pluralsight videos on C++. This time on Restrictions on Unions in C++ 11, C99 Compatibility, Deprecations, Removals and Writing Cross-platform Code. As always, I practiced and made some modifications to certify what I learned.

_Have a great day =)_
