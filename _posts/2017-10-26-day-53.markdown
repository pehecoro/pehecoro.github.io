Day 53 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I went back to C++ course in pluralsight. So I started from Move Semantics by seeing its implementation, the move function, the guidelines, and I saw some examples of move-only types. Within this I also saw about reference qualifiers for member functions. I really enjoyed going back to the course and following up by testing and modifying some of my own codes, because I could also combine with some great "practices" that I read in Scott Meyers' book. Anyway I will not post the code because I think it is more a testing area so that I can have fun and reinforce learning.

_Have a great day =)_
