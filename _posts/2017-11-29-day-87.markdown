Day 87 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I studied a little more by the practices of FreeCodeCamp and I returned to my project of OpenGL. As the idea is to remember some things, I chose to start from a Stencil Testing project and make some modifications that I thought about right now.   
I have some more ideas in mind, so I plan to do more OpenGL projects by taking advantage of everything I've learned about C++.

_Have a great day =)_
