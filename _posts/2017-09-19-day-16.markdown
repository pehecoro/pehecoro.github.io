Day 16 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I continued with the evolution of the simple quest system. Well, in a way, I first had to complete the quests-completing part to continue with some improvements in the code. I have some problems with "exotic" text input, but I left it aside by finding several parts that I could have done better. On the one hand it's good because I can see some flaws, but on the other hand, maybe I need to study more better ways to implement certain things.  
All code continues to be updated in my github in learning-cpp / projects

_Have a great day =)_
