Day 83 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I followed the Beautiful C++ course. I saw about Count, Find and their variations. Although I have already used Count and Find, except the variations, I could see more clearly the importance of these functions, how they work, and how they can easily adapt to our needs without having to create our own. As usual, I followed the demonstrations in my editor.

_Have a great day =)_
