Day 62 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw some features for C++ 14 through Pluralsight. Unfortunately, today I could not fully experience these new features, but as the idea of the video was to give a general idea about the news, it was not necessary to understand very well. Anyway, this course is over and I will start a new one tomorrow with a lot more cool things to apply in C++, and of course, without stopping using everything already learned.

_Have a great day =)_
