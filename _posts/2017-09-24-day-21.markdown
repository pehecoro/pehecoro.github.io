Day 21 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I started the day seeing some videos from TheChernoProject about classes, structs, explicit ... Then I went to see some things about SDL. Although I've already ventured a little bit into this, I've refined some early tutorials using the knowledge I have of C ++ right now. Later I came back to my progress on [Learn OpenGL][learnopengl] by adding the emission map, which honestly made my boxes pretty cool.

_Have a great day =)_
