Day 64 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw some more techniques and macros to help me debug C++ applications. It was very cool to be able to create a trace of a point that I define, even more implementing with the variadic templates and, of course, remembering the difference that makes a good debugger.

_Have a great day =)_
