Day 97 of 100

Hello my friend,

After studying Anti Aliasing, I was able to move on to the Post-processing part of the Breakout tutorial. Well, it's just amazing the effects you can create, including some that I created earlier with the introduction to framebuffers. Although I risk some of my own, the effects suggested by the author are pretty cool. As for example Chaos:   
![Breakout - Chaos]({{"/images/breakoutPostP.png" | https://pehecoro.github.io/images/breakoutPostP.png}})   

_Have a great day =)_
