Day 44 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I practiced Depth Testing and Stencil Testing. I delineated my model successfully, and took the opportunity to test further changes in Stencil Testing, including simulating a shadow. After I went through the Scott Meyers book and saw two more items, about preventing destructors from throwing exceptions and never calling virtual functions during construction or destruction.
