Day 75 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I started the Design Patterns in C++ course. The first pattern was the Adapter, I found it interesting and I could relate to some examples given by the author (Unfortunately, it's not the same, but it's good). I also followed the course by developing small classes that represented an Adapter. Anyway I didn't finish the module, but I believe it'll be more and more interesting.

_Have a great day =)_
