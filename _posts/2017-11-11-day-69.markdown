Day 69 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw about Equality and Relational Operators and Vectors. Today was not a very new feature for me, but I've seen other ways to implement them, good practices and I'm improving my class to become ideal for manipulation. I practiced the exemplified and ventured with some uses of the operators overloaded by me.

_Have a great day =)_
