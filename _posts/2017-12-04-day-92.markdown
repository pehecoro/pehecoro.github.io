Day 92 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I started a tutorial on the Breakout game. I had already started a similar project but in SDL. Until then I followed the creation of some classes to abstract a series of processes that I do in the natural flow of the tutorial. It is quite interesting how it was abstracted by the author, but as there was a change of some things and some things that I preferred to optimize I ended up following a relatively own way.

_Have a great day =)_
