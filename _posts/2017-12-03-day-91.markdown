Day 91 of 100

Hello my friend,

I trained more on Framebuffers today. So I made some remaining examples and some modifications of my own. The idea is to practice some more before leaving for the next adventure =D.   
![MoreFramebuffers1]({{"/images/moreFramebufferBlur.png" | https://pehecoro.github.io/images/moreFramebufferBlur.png}})   
![MoreFramebuffers2]({{"/images/moreFramebufferDiv.png" | https://pehecoro.github.io/images/moreFramebufferDiv.png}})   

_Have a great day =)_
