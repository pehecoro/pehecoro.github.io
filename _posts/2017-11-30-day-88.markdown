Day 88 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I started to see a very interesting subject, which I already wanted to bring to my small OpenGL study projects: Text Rendering. I would like to put some details on what is being rendered in my projects and now I believe I can start implementing some little things. I followed the amazing OpenGL website ever - [learnopengl.com][learnopengl]. Quite excited to create a few more things, but I will insist on better understanding the "basics" behind the scenes.

_Have a great day =)_
