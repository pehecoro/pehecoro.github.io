Day 42 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I have seen some videos from Cherno, both OpenGL and C ++, and I studied Stencil Testing. And certainly, Stencil Testing was something that I wanted to implement but did not know that there was such a good and "internal" tool for it. Now I can outline objects and, perhaps, the ones I select. The tool also has other uses, however I'm trying to outline the objects I've drawn on the screen during this journey.

_Have a great day =)_
