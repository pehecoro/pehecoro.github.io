Day 100 of 100

Hello my friend,

A great challenge comes to an end, but is it the end or just a start? These 100 days were able to grant me the habit of daily study, of persistence in the face of any problems, and of course much learning. Today I finished the breakout tutorial created by [Joey de Vries][joeydevries] at [learnopengl.com][learnopengl]. It was quite enriching all abstractions and gather all the knowledge gained throughout the tutorial to create this game. With the final considerations made by Joey, I will persist with some optimizations in the project, patterns study, "more graphics" and own projects.

_Have a great day =)_
