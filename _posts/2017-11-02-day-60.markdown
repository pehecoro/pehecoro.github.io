Day 60 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw some more Pluralsight videos about C++. Were again very interesting videos, such as Thread Local Storage, Generalized Attributes and POD Types. But I realize that I will have to review more. Even watching the videos, noting certain points and practicing them, I still did not feel firm.

_Have a great day =)_
