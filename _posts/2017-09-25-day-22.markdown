Day 22 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I borrowed Scott Meyers' book (Effective C++) from the library and started reading it. In a few pages I have already been able to remember some points I had forgotten. However, I believe it will be most effective when I have a project.  
After that I started implementing a binary tree using some of the resources I learned from C++. Since I have not finished, I will not post it, but I intend to do so tomorrow.

_Have a great day =)_
