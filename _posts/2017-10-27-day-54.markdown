Day 54 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I have seen more videos by Pluralsight on Perfect Forwarding, Reference Collapsing, constexpr mechanism, functions and literal types. All these topics I could practice according to the examples given and as I wanted to understand better.

_Have a great day =)_
