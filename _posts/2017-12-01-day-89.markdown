Day 89 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I studied some more about Graphics Rendering Pipeline and continued practicing Text Rendering. As my goal is to modify according to my ideas to learn better, I created a dynamic text as the camera direction and some static texts as the positions of the windows. I used, as the basis of the project, what I created in the Blending tutorial.
