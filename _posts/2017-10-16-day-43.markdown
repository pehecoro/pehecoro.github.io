Day 43 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I read about two items from scott meyers' book. One is about explicitly disabling the use of compiler-generated functions that you do not want, and the other is to declare constructors as virtual in polymorphic base classes. Both of these items I put into practice and made some modifications to follow the compiler's treatment. The second item I had seen but not with the clear explanation given by the Book.

_Have a great day =)_
