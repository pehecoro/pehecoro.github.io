Day 85 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw more about Sorting and finished the module. As always, I followed the course by developing my own examples and better identifying the uses of the new functions I learned. The curious thing is that in the past I used a function from the C library to generate random numbers, I now use a specific random library, which, as before, I used for the Shuffle. After I saw how to sort a collection partially, copy it, check if it's sorted and also through a pivot without guarantee of ordering the other elements. Well, I will still practice more but I intend to start some specific project and apply what I'm learning.

_Have a great day =)_
