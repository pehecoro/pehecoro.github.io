Day 58 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I saw Pluralsight videos about Explicit Conversion Operators, Inline Namespaces, alignof, alignas, sizeof and an overview of Memory Model. They were interesting topics and I practiced them as always. However, I had to turn to other sources for alignment, which gave me a bit more confidence.

_Have a great day =)_
