Day 80 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I started to see the Decorator Design Pattern. The idea is to add new behaviors to specific objects without interfering with others in the same class. I believe I'll have to exercise this pattern more, but all of them are very interesting so far, I even learn new techniques during the example, so I don't think it'll be a problem.

_Have a great day =)_
