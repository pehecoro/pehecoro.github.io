Day 52 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I read about effective c++ and a little bit about framebuffers, which in a way I was already using without, let's say, customize it. Although it was a topic that interested me (what a surprise haha), I felt that it was necessary to review some previous things, even if nearby, such as Depth testing and Stencil testing. I will still use today to reorganize some daily quests.

_Have a great day =)_
