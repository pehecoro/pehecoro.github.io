Day 41 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I studied a section on Depth testing. An interesting part in the tutorial I had not given so much attention. I tested the various depth test functions to see how they behaved in a scenario proposed by the tutorial.
Another interesting part that I had already noticed but did not know would be a problem in fact, is z-fighting. Anyway the tutorial exposes 3 techniques to reduce it.

_Have a great day =)_
