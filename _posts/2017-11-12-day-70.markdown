Day 70 of 100

Hello my friend,

I continued my walk through Smart Classes. This time I saw about List and Movement within Containers. As always, quite interesting, mainly because I practiced together and I could see the list code, as, for example, some operators were overloaded to make the class even better. A few things about container handling, as exemplified in vector and list, I had already seen on the Cherno channel, but it was great to review and have another vision for me to accommodate learning.

_Have a great day =)_
