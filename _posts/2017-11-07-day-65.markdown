Day 65 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I reviewed smart pointers at Pluralsight. I have remembered some points that are essential for C++ developers (know how to manage their resources). To, in fact, further consolidate, I practiced unique_ptr, shared_ptr, and weak_ptr one more time.

_Have a great day =)_
