Day 49 of 100

Hello my friend,

Today I read a bit of Effective C ++ but there were a few more items that I would have difficulty putting into practice outside of a project, so I preferred to put my hands on the OpenGL journey again and read about blending. Despite being a "common" feature it is much cooler to know how to present it in fact behind the cameras haha.

_Have a great day =)_
