Day 34 of 100

Hello my friend,

today I watched two OpenGL intro videos made by Cherno. They were good videos to remember and learn new things in the initial construction of a program using OpenGL. Then I saw some videos about Vulkan. So, in order to remember all my process and reinforce what I learned about OpenGL I rewrote the main code of my project.

_Have a great day =)_
