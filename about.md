Welcome, I'm Pedro.

I'm student of Computer Science and I have several likes. During my course I'm studying and practicing the many flavors of my area, however among several there is a special one: __Computer Graphics__.
Even as a novice (and I don't know how all things works _yet_) I'm very excited for every pixel.

My main goal is to be a Graphics Engineer.
